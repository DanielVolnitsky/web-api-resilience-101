# A deployment is a resource that manages a set of identical pods.
# It ensures that the desired number of pods are running and replaces any that fail or become unresponsive.
# Deployments are used to manage stateless applications, where the individual pods can be replaced without affecting the overall state of the application.

# A service is a resource that provides network access to a set of pods.
# It creates a stable IP address and DNS name for a set of pods, and load-balances traffic across them.
# Services are used to expose stateless or stateful applications to the network, and allow other components in the cluster to access them.
